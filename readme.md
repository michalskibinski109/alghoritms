- array
  - 
- queue
- stack
- linked list
- graph
- tree



## linked list 
Each node has:
- value
- reference to next node

| operation | time complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| insert    | O(1) 🐇          |
| delete    | O(1) 🐇          |
| search    | O(n) 🐌          |


### Adventages: 😃
- dynamic size 
- **insertion and deletion is O(1)** 🐇

### Disadvantages: 😥
- random access is not possible 🎲
- extra memory for pointer  👉
- a lot of time to changing pointers
- If single linked list, we can't go traverse from end to start
- **searching is O(n)** 🐌
